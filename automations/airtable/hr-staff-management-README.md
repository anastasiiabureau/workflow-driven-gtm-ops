## 💡 What This Module Does

This module covers all people-operations workflows in one place:

- **👥 People Management** — employee record cards, new hire creation, all contact and contract details, teacher specialization management
- **🚀 Staff Onboarding** — structured pipeline from offer acceptance to first session (Offer Sent → Contract Signed → System Setup → First Session); form-based, no automations
- **🔄 Fixed-term contract renewal** — 4-automation state machine; HR writes a note, the system handles every stage transition
- **🔗 Teacher → Class sync** — 2 automations; teacher linked to classes automatically on approval or specialization change
- **📋 Absence logging & substitution planning** — form-based entry, report view for coverage planning; no automations

## 🖥️ Interfaces

### [Studio HR Hub](../../interfaces/studio-hr-hub-README.md)

The primary HR workspace. All 6 automations are triggered from here.

| Page | What the user does here | Automations triggered |
|---|---|---|
| **🚀 HR Control Center** | Daily overview — active staff count, pending renewals, onboarding pipeline status, current absences | — read-only |
| **📂 Staff Directory** | Creates new hire records, edits all staff details, manages teacher specializations, sets approval status | Teacher Approval to Class Workflow (5) · Update Teacher Sync Class (6) |
| **🔄 Contract Renewal Management** | Reviews employees with `🟡 Renewal Required` status, writes renewal notes, updates contract dates, marks termination | Auto-start Renewal (1) · Auto-mark Done (2) · Non-Renewal Auto-Close (3) · Finalize & Reset (4) |
| **⏳ New Staff Onboarding** | Moves new hires through the pipeline: Offer Sent → Contract Signed → System Setup → First Session | — manual pipeline |
| **✍️ Staff Absence Form** | Logs sick leave, holidays, and planned absences — creates a record in `Stuff_Absences` on submit | — form submit |
| **📋 Staff Absence Reporting** | Overview of all absences — past, current, upcoming — for substitution planning | — read-only |

## ⚡ Automation Overview

6 automations across two independent pipelines:

**Contract Renewal Pipeline (1–4)** — a sequential state machine. Each automation picks up where the previous left off. HR writes notes and makes the actual contract decision; the system handles all status transitions.

**Teacher → Class Sync (5–6)** — a sync mechanism. Keeps `Classes.Qualified Teachers` always current. Fires once on new teacher approval, and again on every specialization change.

| # | Automation | Trigger field | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [HR] Auto-start Renewal | `Update on Contract(Renew)` updated | `CDD_Renewal Progress` → `In Discussion` · logs timestamp |
| 2 | Done: Auto-mark Renewal as Done | `CDD_End_Date` updated + conditions met | `CDD_Renewal Progress` → `Done` |
| 3 | Non-Renewal: Auto-Close | `CDD_Renewal Progress = Termination` + `Contract_status = Inactive` | Logs reason · archives record · Progress → `Done` |
| 4 | [HR] Renewal: Finalize & Reset | `CDD_Renewal Progress = Done` | Clears renewal notes · resets Progress → `Not Started` |
| 5 | Teacher Approval to Class Workflow | `Contact_Type = Yoga_Teacher` + `Specialization` filled + not rejected | Adds teacher to `Classes.Qualified Teachers` for all matching class types |
| 6 | Update Teacher Sync Class | `Specialization` field updated | Re-links teacher in `Classes.Qualified Teachers` for each updated specialization |

## 👤 User Workflows

### 👥 People Management — Staff Directory

HR creates a new hire record in the Staff Directory after a candidate accepts an offer. All contact and contract details are filled in one place. For teachers, filling `Specialization` triggers automation 5 — the teacher is linked to matching classes automatically. Ongoing: HR and admins edit records, update specializations, manage contract changes.

→ [Full workflow — Studio HR Hub](../../interfaces/studio-hr-hub-README.md#staff-directory)

---

### 🚀 Staff Onboarding

After the record is created in Staff Directory, the hire moves through the New Staff Onboarding pipeline. For yoga teachers, `Specialization` is filled first — automation 5 fires and links the teacher to all matching classes. Contract dates are then recorded. The hire moves through: **Offer Sent → Contract Signed → System Setup → First Session**. Once complete, `Contract_status` calculates to `🟢 Active`.

---

### 🔄 Fixed-Term Contract Renewal

Fixed-term employees appear on the Kanban board automatically when their contract is within 30 days of expiry — no manual flagging needed. HR writes a note → automation 1 fires (`In Discussion`). HR manages the negotiation and sends the contract. HR updates the end date → automation 2 fires (`Done`). If non-renewal, HR sets Termination → automations 3 and 4 close and reset the cycle.

→ [Full workflow — Studio HR Hub](../../interfaces/studio-hr-hub-README.md#renewal)

---

### 📋 Absence Logging & Substitution Planning

All absences are logged through the **Staff Absence Form** — employee selected, dates set, type chosen (Sick Leave / Vacation / Personal), documentation attached if needed. On submit, a record is created in `Stuff_Absences` and linked to the employee card automatically. No automation fires — the form handles the record creation.

[![Staff Absence Form](../../assets/interfaces/3.Stuff_absence_form.png)](../../assets/interfaces/3.Stuff_absence_form.png)

The **Staff Absence Reporting** view shows all logged absences — past, current, and upcoming — for identifying coverage gaps and planning substitutions.

### Automation Detail

#### Automation 1 — [HR] Auto-start Renewal

**Trigger:** `Update on Contract(Renew)` updated in `Stuff & Teachers`
**Condition:** `Contract_status = 🟡 Renewal Required` AND `CDD_Renewal Progress = Not Started`
**Action:** `CDD_Renewal Progress` → `In Discussion` · `Discussion started on` → current timestamp

#### Automation 2 — Done: Auto-mark Renewal as Done

**Trigger:** `CDD_End_Date` updated in `Stuff & Teachers`
**Condition:** `Contract Type = CDD` AND `Contract_status = 🟢 Active` AND `CDD_Renewal Progress = Contract Sent`
**Action:** `CDD_Renewal Progress` → `Done` · logs renewal confirmation via `Helper_Log_Text`

#### Automation 3 — Non-Renewal: Auto-Close

**Trigger:** Record matches conditions in `Stuff & Teachers`
**Condition:** `CDD_Renewal Progress = Termination/Non-Renewal` AND `Contract_status = 🔴 Inactive (Terminated)`

#### Automation 4 — [HR] Renewal: Finalize & Reset

**Trigger:** `CDD_Renewal Progress = Done` in `Stuff & Teachers`
**Action:** `Update on Contract(Renew)` → cleared (from `Helper_Log_Text`) · `CDD_Renewal Progress` → `Not Started`

#### Automation 5 — Teacher Approval to Class Workflow

**Trigger:** Record matches conditions in `Stuff & Teachers`
**Condition:** `Contact Type = Yoga_Teacher` AND `NEW:Approval Status` is empty AND `Specialization` is not empty

### Formulas

  IF({Contract Type} = "CDD",
    IF({CDD_Renewal Progress} = "⛔️ Termination",
      IF(IS_AFTER(TODAY(), {CDD_End_Date}), "🔴 Inactive (Terminated)", "🟠 Termination Pending"),
      IF(IS_AFTER(TODAY(), {CDD_End_Date}), "🔴 Expired",

#### `CDD_Days_until_expiration`
```
IF(
  {CDD_End_Date},
  IF(DATETIME_DIFF({CDD_End_Date}, TODAY(), 'days') < 0,
    "🔴 Expired " & ABS(DATETIME_DIFF({CDD_End_Date}, TODAY(), 'days')) & " days ago",
    DATETIME_DIFF({CDD_End_Date}, TODAY(), 'days')),
